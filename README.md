CrossBrowserImageUploader
=========================

Image file uploader with preview, working on mobile browser (IPhone, Android...) using HTML 5 image API

IE10 Mobile is not working because input file is disabled by default.
If anyone find a workaround for doing that on Windows Phone please contact me.
Thanks.
